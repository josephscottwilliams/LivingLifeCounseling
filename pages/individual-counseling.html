            Individual Counseling
            Relationship Issues- Have you ever thought about how many relationships we have in life?  It is no wonder that at times things get murky.  It is very refreshing to be able to speak with a trained counselor that can offer honest feedback and guidance as to how to address some of those issues that frequently pop up in relationships.
            Anxiety- Feeling your heart rate pick up, foggy thinking, sweaty palms, fear?   The more you think about it the worse it becomes?  Our counselors offer various approaches to help you overcome those situations and face them with a new perspective.
             Depression- Changes in  appetite, trouble sleeping, trouble concentrating, lack of interest in activities that are usually fun for you, withdrawal, and negative thinking are just some of the symptoms suffered by those with depression.  Let us help you work through these lower times and share tools to help you reach your potential.
             Anger Management- Finding that you become irritated and frustrated in no time at all, or for reasons that don't fit the situation?  Our counselors can help you identify triggers, become more self aware and help you manage your reactions for a more successful outcome for not only you but those around you.
            Grief and Loss-Often life deals us some very untimely, unexpected losses that we are just not prepared for. It could be a loss of life, loss of good health, loss of a relationship, loss of a job that just seems too hard to get through.  We are prepared to help you through those trying times that are most difficult, but can become building blocks to help us gain greater strength.
