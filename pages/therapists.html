                    to obtain behavior changes that are sometimes needed to address certain behaviors that may be
                    interfering with regular life routines.
                    it is important to me to provide a safe and respectful environment while offering you quality
                    care.

                                Are you struggling with anxiety or feeling down and lack energy? These are symptoms
                                of limiting beliefs that are causing you to suffer. The hard times you have are really
                                challenges to grow--in disguise. We can grow the most during these times—it is how
                                we handle a challenge that makes the experience a “grind” or a “growing” experience.
                                Often it’s often hard to banish fears and doubts by yourself. Counseling is really all
                                about figuring out &#39;&#39;what you want” and then supporting you on your path. This is where
                                I come in. My sessions are a balance between encouraging you and challenging you to
                                release your limitations. The focus is on your potential and emphasizes the importance
                                of growth and self-actualization. When you do this, you are capable of facing any of
                                your challenges.
                                If this makes sense to you, give me a call to see if we are a good fit.

Mark takes a person-centered approach to therapy, meaning he sees the power for growth and the direction of growth residing in the client rather than in the therapist.

                                        He believes that only in such an environment can one hear one’s own voice apart from the judgmental “shoulds” and opinions of others, and can fully face one’s issues and decide for oneself what the best course of action might be. Evidenced-based research indicates that the likely results of therapy will be a greater clarity of what one truly thinks and feels, greater effectiveness in problem solving, feeling less tense and anxious, less vulnerable and thus less defensive in relationships, feeling more confident and comfortable in one’s own skin, and a greater sense of self-control and self-direction in life.

                                            My passion is helping people heal. Healing comes in many forms, including emotional, spiritual, relational, and physical. Healing in one area affects the other areas as well. I use a heart centered, spiritual approach to helping others. Heart centered counseling is an effective and compassionate way of being with you. It helps you be able to speak from the heart, truly be yourself and discover the beauty, strength, and wholeness that you already hold inside of you. Together we can build a strong, safe, nurturing relationship that promotes healing and well-being.

                                            I am a Licensed Professional Counselor and have worked with adults, children and families the majority of my life, in all different capacities. I have training in adult, group, family, adolescent, child and play therapy. I work with all ages, 2 to 102! Working with children is one of my passions. My philosophy in working with children is that I help the child feel that he/she is a unique individual worthy of love, respect, and nurturing. Because of this, they are able to express feelings and work through their difficulties during play, which results in healing. I love working with parents, teaching them the techniques of positive parenting that can lead to healthy, harmonious relationships with their children. I also enjoy working with adults dealing with depression, anxiety, or grief.

                                                Jeff believes the potential for growth and healing already is within the individual. Therapy helps people remove blocks that limit their growth. Individuals can nurture and cultivate these natural tendencies towards the full expression of their individuality. People can experience greater fulfillment in their personal life and relationships through the counseling process.
