            Children & Adolescents
            Academic Issues
           ADHD - Do you ever wonder if your child may have trouble attention issues or whether they are just busy children?  We are able to process through those questions and discuss possible symptoms to allow you to make the most informed decisions for your children.  If you find that you may be interested in pursuing screeners, we can also provide those tools and offer scoring for further review by your physician.
           
           Behavior Issues- Do your children suddenly or maybe not so suddenly start exhibiting behaviors that are hard to understand?  You are not sure what has happened, what has changed, or where it came from.  We are here to help and have counselors with years of experience with children and behavior issues.
           
           Transitions-Life brings us many transitions in life which include moves, relationship changes, divorce, new baby in the family.  These are all major life changes that can cause difficulties not only for adults, but for children as well.  We offer play therapy for younger children and counseling for children to teens to assist them with the needed tools to navigate these changes.
           
           Foster Children/CANS Testing-  We have counselors with years of experience to assist foster children during their transitions, address trauma, and support them in their journey to a forever family.  We also have trained counselors that are able to offer State mandated CANS testing in a timely manner.
